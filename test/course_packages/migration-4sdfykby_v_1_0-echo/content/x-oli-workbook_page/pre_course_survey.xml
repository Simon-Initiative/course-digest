                    <p> Two opposing words appear above and below the field to fill in the 
                statement "Chemistry is...". Rate how well these words describe your
                feelings about chemistry. Think carefully and try not to include your feelings
                toward chemistry teachers or chemistry courses. For each line, choose a position
                between the two words that describes exactly how you feel. The middle position (4) is if you are undecided or have no feelings related
                to the terms on that row.</p>
