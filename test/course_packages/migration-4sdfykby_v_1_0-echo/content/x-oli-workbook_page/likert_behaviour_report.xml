            <body>
                <p id="daf722699d7a49d087213f05f424b721">As you recall, students report using many
                    kinds of strategies for studying course material. You have just completed your
                    post-Student Cognition Toolbox course Study Behavior Inventory. This current
                    inventory measured the kinds of strategies you reported planning to use when
                    preparing for future exams. As you know by now, not all study strategies work as
                    effectively as others to promote meaningful learning, and cognitive science
                    informs us that certain kinds of study strategies are better than others in
                    helping students to learn. Laboratory experiments and studies of students in
                    academic courses, just like the ones you’re taking, have uncovered the kinds of
                    strategies that are associated with better learning. These strategies promote
                    deep processing of material. </p>

                    responded to items on the Study Behavior Inventory reflects your planned use of
                    particular study strategies. The bar graph illustrates your agreement with each
                    statement on a scale from “1” (not true of you) to “6” (very true of you). The
                    bars on the left (items 1-8 on the survey) are those study strategies that are
                    known to be associated with deeper cognitive processing and better learning. The
                    bars on the right (items 9-16 on the survey) are those that are known to be
                    associated with shallower cognitive processing and do not promote the most
                    effective learning, and can sometimes interfere with learning. For example, for
                    prompt 9, you should first try working through challenging material on your own
                    before asking others (e.g., a classmate, TA or course instructor) for help. </p>
                <p id="d511bd3e1ee6401a83c1c797ae4ffb26">The bar graph provides a visual
                    representation to help you understand how you have managed your studying until
                    now. The goal is for you to elevate the bars on the left (those associated with
                    deep cognitive processing) and to decrease the bars on the right (those
                    associated with shallow cognitive processing). </p>
