Boxplots are most useful when presented side-by-side for comparing and contrasting distributions from two or more groups. </p>

            <p id="a7dbed46f0de4d0a94e5b6ea9dcfd556">So far we have examined the age distributions of Oscar winners for males and females separately.</p>

                <em style="italic">compare</em> the age distributions of actors and actresses who won best acting Oscars. To do that we will look at side-by-side boxplots of the age distributions by gender.  Recall also that we found the five-number summary and means for both distributions. For the Best Actress dataset, we did the calculations by hand. For the Best Actor dataset, we used statistical software, and here are the results we got:

                        <em style="bold">Center:</em> The graph reveals that the age distribution of the males is higher than the females&apos; age distribution. This is supported by the numerical measures. The median age for females (34.5) is lower than for the males (43.5). Actually, it should be noted that even the third quartile of the females&apos; distribution (42) is lower than the median age for males. We therefore conclude that in general, actresses win the Best Actress Oscar at a younger age than actors do.

On the other hand, if we look at the IQR, which measures the variability only among the middle 50% of the distribution, we see slightly more spread in the ages of males (IQR = 12.5) than females (IQR = 11.5). We conclude that among all the winners, the actors&apos; ages are more alike than the actresses&apos; ages. However, the middle 50% of the age distribution of actresses is more homogeneous than the actors&apos; age distribution.

            <p id="b8e22ce18a4f47bdae55d024611b2b3f">When looking at the graph, the similarities and differences between the two distributions are striking. Both distributions have roughly the same center (medians are 61.4 for Pitt, and 62.7 for San Francisco). However, the temperatures in Pittsburgh have a much larger variability than the temperatures in San Francisco (Range: 49 vs. 12. IQR: 36.5 vs. 5). </p>
            <p id="aa0c792c85ae457cb8e0b3c621154eb8">The practical interpretation of the results we got is that the weather in San Francisco is much more consistent than the weather in Pittsburgh, which varies a lot during the year. Also, because the temperatures in San Francisco vary so little during the year, knowing that the median temperature is around 63 is actually very informative. On the other hand, knowing that the median temperature in Pittsburgh is around 61 is practically useless, since temperatures vary so much during the year, and can get much warmer or much colder. </p>
            <p id="f44f0ee8953441d3a84a160a1ef8a69e">Note that this example provides more intuition about variability by interpreting small variability as consistency, and large variability as lack of consistency. Also, through this example we learned that the center of the distribution is more meaningful as a typical value for the distribution when there is little variability (or, as statisticians say, little &quot;noise&quot;) around it. When there is large variability, the center loses its practical meaning as a typical value. </p>
