    <p>There should be one on the following paragrap:</p>

      <anchor>propre</anchor>

   </extra> lessive, je présume.</p>

      <anchor>Il téléphone à moi.</anchor>

			There should be two popups in the following paragraphs, enabled via hover over the words

				electrolytes

			One important property of the resulting solution is its ability to conduct electricity.
			Conductivity of a solution can be tested with an apparatus such as the one seen below.
			Solutions that contain charged particles (ions) allow the electric current to flow
			between the anodes. This will complete the circuit and cause the light bulb to light up.
			Substances, like NaCl, that conduct electricity when dissolved in water are called

				<anchor>
					electrolytes
				</anchor>
				<meaning>
					<material>
						<p>
							substances that produces ions when dissolved in water
						</p>

			. More specifically NaCl is a

				<meaning>
					<material>
						<p>
							substance that dissociates or ionizes completely when dissolved in

			because it conducts electricity very well.

    <p>Like matter, energy comes in different types. One scheme classifies energy into two
      types: (i)<extra>
          <anchor>potential energy</anchor>
          <meaning>
              <material>
                  <p>energy of a particle or system of particles derived from relative
                      position, composition, or condition</p>
              </material>
          </meaning>
      </extra>, the energy an object has because of its relative position, composition, or
      condition, and (ii)<extra>
          <anchor>kinetic energy</anchor>
          <meaning>
              <material>
                  <p>energy of a moving body, in joules, equal to 1/2 mv<sup>2</sup> (where
                          <em style="italic">m</em> = mass and <em style="italic">v</em> =
                      velocity)</p>
              </material>
          </meaning>
      </extra>, the energy that an object possesses because of its motion. Water at the top of
      a waterfall or dam has potential energy because of its position; when it flows downward
      through generators, it has kinetic energy that can be used to do work and produce
      electricity in a hydroelectric plant. A battery has potential energy because the
      chemicals within it can produce electricity that can do work.</p>
