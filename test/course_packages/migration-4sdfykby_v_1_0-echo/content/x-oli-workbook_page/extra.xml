			One important property of the resulting solution is its ability to conduct electricity.
			Conductivity of a solution can be tested with an apparatus such as the one seen below.
			Solutions that contain charged particles (ions) allow the electric current to flow
			between the anodes. This will complete the circuit and cause the light bulb to light up.
			Substances, like NaCl, that conduct electricity when dissolved in water are called

							substances that produces ions when dissolved in water

			because it conducts electricity very well.
