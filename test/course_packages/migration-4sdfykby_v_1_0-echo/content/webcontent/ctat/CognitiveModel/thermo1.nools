Thermal energy from the reflected sunlight is transferred to a liquid pumped to the top of the tower. A chemist wants to determine the specific heat capacity of the liquid being used. She adds 2.5 kJ of heat to a 20.0 g sample of the liquid and observes that the temperature increases from 23.0 oC to 116.9 oC. What is the specific heat capacity of the liquid in J/g oC? Please use the label \"C metal\" for your final answer.";
