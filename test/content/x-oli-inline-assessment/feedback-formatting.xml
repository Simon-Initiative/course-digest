            <body>Potassium has an atomic mass of 39.098 amu. This element has 3 naturally occurring
                isotopes: K−39, K−40, and K−41. Without doing any calculations and without any
                additional information, what can you conclude about the relative abundances of these
                three isotopes of potassium?</body>

                <hint>The atomic mass on the periodic table are calculated based on the percent
                    abundance of each isotope. </hint>
                <hint>Isotopes with greater percent abundance contribute more to the atomic mass
                    than those with a lesser percent abundance.</hint>
                <explanation>Because the atomic mass on the periodic table is very close to 39, you
                    can conclude that the most abundant of the 3 isotopes is K-39. <p>In fact the
                    percent abundances are: K-39 is 93.3%. K-41 is 6.7%. K-40 is 0.012%. </p> It is
                    common that elements have one isotope that is far more abundant than the other
                    (although not always the case). If the atomic mass on the periodic table is very
                    close to a whole number, it is safe to assume that if you rounded that value to
                    the nearest whole number you would have the mass number of the most common
                    isotope for that element. Like we see with potassium.</explanation>
