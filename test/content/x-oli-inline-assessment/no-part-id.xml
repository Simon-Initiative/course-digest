            <body>
                <p>What is the probability that the mean SAT-M score of a random sample of 4
                    students who took the test that year is more than 600? Explain why you can solve
                    this problem, even though the sample size (n = 4) is very low.</p>

                <explanation>
                    <p>Since the scores on the SAT-M in the population follow a normal distribution,
                        the sample mean automatically also follows a normal distribution, for any
                        sample size <?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101122T195548-0500" content=" (see comment 4)"?>. Therefore, the mean has a normal distribution with the same
                        mean as the population, 507, and standard deviation </p>

                    <p>The z-score of 600 is therefore:</p>

                        alt="equation for Z score = 1.68" />
                    <p>And therefore,</p>

                        alt="equation for probability difference =.0465" />
                    <p>We find that while it is very common to find students who score above 600 on
                        the SAT-M, it would be quite unlikely (4.65% chance) for the mean score of a
                        sample of 4 students to be above 600. </p>
