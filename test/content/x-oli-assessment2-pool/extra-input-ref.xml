                standard deviation σ = 8 points. </p>
            <p>Suppose that the top 4% of the exams will be given an
                A+. In order to be given an A+, an exam must earn at least what score? Report your

                <feedback>Correct. We need to find the exam score such that the probability of
                    getting a score
                    above it is 0.04. Equivalently, we need to find the exam score such that the
                    probability of
                    getting a score below it is 1 − 0.04 = 0.96. The z-score with a probability
                    closest to 0.96
                    (which is 0.9599) is 1.75. This means that the exam score that we are looking
                    for is 1.75 * SD
                    above the mean, and therefore is 75 + 1.75 * SD = 75 + 14 = 89. </feedback>

                <feedback>Incorrect. It seems that you have found the minimum exam score in order
                    for an exam to
                    be in the top 40% of all exam scores. However, you should find the minimum exam
                    score that
                    would allow an exam to earn an A+.</feedback>

                <feedback>Incorrect. It seems that you have found the proportion of exams that have
                    a score of
                    at most 79 points. However, you should find the minimum exam score that would
                    allow an exam to
                    earn an A+.</feedback>
